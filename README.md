#Nearby Test Project

A first draft of an android app which uses its location and the location received from a nearby phone to calculate how far they are apart.
If the distance is less than a specified value (ie 2m required by UK social distancing), the app throws an alarm warning the phone owner to back away. Most people seem to underestimate how far 2m actually is and stand too close.



ToDo:

- [ ] Use Connections API using peer2peer strategy (will communicate only between android)
- [ ] responsive UI for lanscape and portrait
- [x] ensure Location is forced to use FINE rather than coarse
