# Nearby Test Project

A first draft of an android app which uses its location and the location received from a nearby
 phone to calculate the distance between them. Uses FINE location data.
 
If the distance is less than a specified value (ie 2m required by UK social distancing), the app
 warns the phone owner to back away. Most people seem to underestimate how far 2m actually is and stand too close.



To Do:

- [ ] Use Connections API using peer2peer strategy (will communicate only between android)
- [ ] responsive UI for landscape and portrait
- [ ] review most accurate methods for finding the distance between devices 
- [x] ensure Location is forced to use FINE rather than coarse
